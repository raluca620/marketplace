            <h1 class="page-title">Detailed dream interpretation...</h1>
            <p>A suitcase in a dream foretells a trip ahead, possibly a very long one, and one that you must take with no excuses. A suitcase is also the symbol of untapped feelings or potentials, the depository of features and qualities that you do not use very regularly. A suitcase stands for older ideas, maybe even past actions or events hidden deeply into your mind.</p>
            <p>Travel dates back to antiquity where wealthy Greeks and Romans would travel for leisure to their summer homes and villas in cities such as Pompeii and Baiae. While early travel tended to be slower, more dangerous, and more dominated by trade and migration, cultural and technological advances over many years have tended to mean that travel has become easier and more accessible.</p>
            <p>Travel by water often provided more comfort and speed than land-travel, at least until the advent of a network of railways in the 19th century. Travel for the purpose of tourism is reported to have started around this time when people began to travel for fun as travel was no longer a hard and challenging task. This was capitalised on by people like Thomas Cook selling tourism packages where trains and hotels were booked together.</p>

            <h3>A luggage can symbolize a vacation and a journey</h3>
            <p>Wherever we go, we take parts of ourselves around, and these situations are the actual contents of the suitcase. Concerns, various insecurities, longings, goals, beliefs, and social status are some of the things that fill your own suitcase. Consequently, dreaming of the suitcase may be about your need for freedom, or that you have to leave behind some of the material inside your “suitcase” (your mental suitcases) before venturing on to the next phase of your life.</p>
